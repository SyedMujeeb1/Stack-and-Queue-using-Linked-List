Project:Implementation of Stack and Queue Using Linked List
The primary goal is to implement Stack and Queue using Linked List to strengthen your understanding of linked lists and gain hands-on experience with these core data structures.
Overview This project implements two fundamental data structures, Stack and Queue, using a Linked List. The objective is to reinforce the understanding of linked lists while exploring the practical application of these structures.
1. Features Stack
    • Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
    • Pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
    • Peek: View the top element without removing it.
    • isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
2. Queue
    • Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
    • Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
    • Front: View the front element without removing it.
    • isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.

How to Run
    1. Clone the repository:
       git clone <repository_url>
       cd <repository_folder>
Compile and run the program: 
For Python: 
python main.py
For Java: 
javac Main.java 
java Main

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to test stack and queue operations.
Time Complexity 
Operation                          Stack (Linked List)                                      Queue (Linked List) Push (Enqueue) 		O(1) 						O(1) 
Pop (Dequeue) 		O(1) 						O(1) 
Peek (Front) 			O(1) 						O(1) 
isEmpty 			O(1) 						O(1)

Example Usage 
Python 
Stack Example 
stack.push(10) 
stack.push(20) 
print(stack.pop()) 
# Output: 20

Queue Example 
queue.enqueue(10) 
queue.enqueue(20) 
print(queue.dequeue()) 
# Output: 10

Purpose
 This implementation demonstrates:
The use of linked lists in building dynamic data structures. Efficient memory usage compared to array-based implementations.
